## What is Locker?

Locker Password Manager (also referred to as Locker) is a cross-platform password management solution: Locker can be 
used as a Web, Mobile, Browser Extension, and Desktop application.

Locker is designed to help Users and Organizations manage their confidential data, especially login credentials 
including passwords. However, to be able to access and decrypt the data in Locker, users need to memorize **ONLY** one 
item: their **Master Password**.
